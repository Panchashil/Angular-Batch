component:

it is made up of three parts
1. template:which represent a view, this is created using html & will be use as interface in angular app
2. class: it is nothing but a code that supports the view, this is created using typescript, the class can any other prog lang contains 
   properties & methods that can be control the business/prog logic & the view.
   eg. hide & show method based on the value of property
3. metadata: component has some metadata attached to it.this is a info that angular needs to decide the class is just a component or a regular class.
   metadata define using decorator which is a feature in typescript. it is nothing but a function the provides the info about the class attached to it.
   and for component the component decorator is used. if we put together then we get a angular component.

component:Components are the most basic building block of an UI in an Angular application.
